# Digital Humanities


The reason I chose **Digital Humanities** as a study subject is so that I can later on work for a company to help making E-Sports more relevant to our modern society.

A company I am looking forward to woorking for is *Freaks 4u*.

They are a company which revolves around the idea to show the competitive aspect of gaming (E-Sports) and help making it more popular by streaming on twitch/youtube or using other social media websites.

Here is also a link to their company website.
